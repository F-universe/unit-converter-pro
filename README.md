UnitConverter Pro is a powerful web application built with Flask for converting values between
different units. It supports categories like Length, Weight, Temperature, Time, Speed, and Volume.
The app provides a simple and interactive web interface where users can select the category, enter a
value, and choose the units to convert from and to. The backend logic is modular, allowing easy extension
with new categories or units. Temperature conversions are handled with specific formulas, while other
categories use linear conversion factors. Every conversion is logged with a timestamp to a text file.
This project is useful for learning Flask, handling user input, and organizing scalable code 
for real-world applications.
